# üè¶ Outstake -- Yield Tokenization Protocol

OutStake is a protocol built entirely around yield-bearing tokens, introducing a new type of non-USD stablecoin model that is tied to the yield rate. This protocol employs an innovative economic model that, compared to other yield token protocols in the market (such as Pendle), offers greater flexibility and composability, providing higher returns and multiple sources of income. The assets supported by OutStake form the foundational support for the Outrun ecosystem, offering a stable base for the entire ecosystem.
