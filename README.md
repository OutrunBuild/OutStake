# üè¶ Outstake -- Built entirely around native yields

_Not Only Native Yield Staking Protocol_  

**Outstake** is a protocol entirely built around native yield tokens, introducing the first non-USD stablecoin model tied to native yield rates. Compared to other yield token protocols in the market, such as **Pendle**, Outstake offers **greater flexibility, enhanced composability**, and provides **higher returns along with multiple sources of income**. The assets supported by Outstake form the foundational support for the Outrun ecosystem, providing a stable base for the entire system. Specifically, Outstake operates as follows:

1. **A New Staking Model Based on Native Yield Tokens**: Outstake adopts a unique design that allows users to control the native yield generated by their assets. Through Outstake, users can mint Principal Tokens (PT) by staking their assets, thereby unlocking liquidity for their staked assets and utilizing these tokens across a range of DeFi applications.

2. **Native Yield Stablecoin (YT)**: The value of the native yield stablecoin is directly tied to the native yield rate. The economic model built around it offers stakers higher income and multiple sources of revenue. It is highly composable, allowing developers to create new products around it, thereby enriching the Outrun ecosystem.

3. **Universal asset principal token (PT)**: The universal asset principal token is obtained by staking the native yields tokens of the same native asset type (such as Stone, stETH, rETH, etc.). Staking native yield tokens of the same native asset type will mint the same universal asset principal token. This allows for liquidity sharing among different native yield tokens of the same asset type, enhancing the composability of PT and reducing the difficulty of liquidity accumulation for native yield tokens.

4. **Position Option Tokens (POT)**: These option tokens represent the right to redeem the native yield token at the end of its lock-up period. This option allows users to trade for a fixed interest rate without trading the PT itself, thereby enhancing capital efficiency.

## Glossary

**Native Yield Token**

Native Yield Token is a general term referring to any token that can generate yield or has potential yield. Examples include Stone, slisBNB, stETH, Blast ETH, GLP, LP liquidity tokens, and so on.

**Native Asset Token**

Native Asset Token refers to the underlying asset token of a Native Yield Token. For example, the Native Asset Token for Stone, stETH, and rETH is ETH.

**SY = Standardized Yield Token**

SY is a vault token based on the ERC5115 standard designed to encapsulate native yield tokens. It can wrap any native yield token and provides a standardized interface for interacting with the yield-generating mechanisms of any native yield token.

In OutStake, staking SY and specifying a lock-up period will mint three types of tokens: **POT (Position Option Token)**, **PT (Principal Token)**, and **YT (Yield Token)**.

**POT = Position Option Token**

POT is an option token based on the ERC1155 standard that is used to encapsulate a user's staked position. Holding a POT represents the right to redeem a position upon maturity. After the POT lock-up period expires, the POT can be burned along with the corresponding PT to redeem the staked Native Yield Tokens. Since POT is based on the ERC1155 standard, it supports partial redemption of the position.

POT records the amount of staked Native Yield Tokens, the fixed principal value, and the number of minted PTs. Upon maturity, there is a fixed relationship between the amount of POT burned, the number of PTs, and the value of the principal being redeemed, thereby establishing a fixed interest rate. Trading POT allows one to trade the right to obtain a fixed interest rate.

**PT = Principal Token**

PT is the principal component separated from the Native Yield Token. Holding PT represents ownership of the principal, which can be redeemed for the Native Yield Token upon the maturity of the POT.

Unlike other protocols, OutStake's PT is a generic ERC20 token with no expiration date. It is also a universal asset principal token; staking Native Yield Tokens of the same asset type will mint the same universal asset principal token. Simply put, staking **stETH**, **rETH**, or **Stone** will mint the same PT token (with the same token contract address), rather than three different PT tokens.

**YT = Yield Token**

YT is the yield component separated from the Native Yield Token. Holding YT represents ownership of all the yield generated by the underlying asset, and it can be burned at any time to redeem the accumulated native yield in the current yield pool.

Unlike other protocols, OutStake's YT is a universal ERC20 token with no expiration date, and YTs minted from different staking times are the same token (with the same token contract address). Unlike PT, each type of Native Yield Token mints a corresponding YT.

The redeemable value of YT (the native yield redeemable by burning YT) starts at zero. Over time, the yield pool will continuously accumulate the native yield of the staked assets, and the redeemable value of YT will continuously grow until it reaches a dynamic equilibrium state, fluctuating around the native yield rate of the Native Yield Token.

## Yield Tokenization

### SY

SY is a token standard that implements a standardized API for wrapped native yield tokens within smart contracts. All native yield tokens can be wrapped into SY, giving them a common interface that can be built upon.

As all SYs have the same mechanism, Outstake interacts with SY as the main interface to all native yield tokens.OutStake automatically converts native yield tokens into SY and vice versa. This process happens automatically behind the scenes, making users feel as if they‚Äôre interacting directly with their native yield tokens instead of having to manually manage the conversion between SY and native yield tokens.

### POT

POT (Position Options Token) represents the right to redeem a position upon maturity. When a user stakes and locks native yield assets, in addition to minting PT and YT, a POT is also minted to encapsulate the user's position.

POT allows holders to burn a fixed amount of PT in the future, when the position lock-up period expires, to redeem a fixed amount of Native Yield Tokens. By trading POT, user can trade the right to obtain a fixed interest rate without needing to trade PT itself.

POT is supported by the ERC1155 standard and divides the position into shares equal to the number of PTs minted, allowing users to trade partial redemption rights of their positions.

### PT

PT is a staked principal token minted by staking SY, designed to unlock the liquidity of staked tokens. When users stake SY, they must specify a lock-up period to mint PT, YT, and POT. The amount of PT is not minted on a 1:1 basis with the staked SY but is instead related to the staking duration (the amount of YT minted) and the **exchange rate** of the Native Yield Token to the Native Asset Token. Simply put, the amount of the Native Yield Token is first converted to the equivalent value of the Native Asset Token, and then the following algorithm is applied to calculate it:

</p>

**YT Redeemable Value:** The native yield that can be redeemed by burning one **YT**.

Therefore, the value of PT is theoretically linked to the value of the Native Asset Token, and its total supply will always be less than the amount of Native Asset Tokens that can be exchanged for the staked Native Yield Tokens, ensuring that the value of PT does not significantly decouple from the value of the Native Asset Token.

Over time, as the yield pool continuously accumulates native yield, the redeemable value of YT increases. The amount of PT minted from newly staked SY will slightly decrease, but regardless of the number of PT minted, users will be able to burn the PT minted at that time to fully redeem their staked SY upon the lock-up period's expiration.

In general, Native Yield Tokens can be roughly classified as follows:

1. Rebase Tokens - Tokens that increase their balance over time.

_Examples: stETH, aUSDC_

2. Reward-bearing Non-Rebase Tokens - Tokens that appreciate in value over time.

_Examples: wstETH, Stone, slisBNB_

**It is important to note**: For reward-bearing non-rebase Native Yield Tokens, the quantity of staked Native Yield Tokens in the position does not change after the lock-up period expires. However, their value (relative to the Native Asset Token's exchange ratio) will increase with the accumulation of native yield. Thus, burning PT does not redeem the same quantity of non-rebase Native Yield Tokens as initially staked; instead, it will be slightly less because part of the value is attributed to YT.

#### Universal Asset Principal Token

OutStake‚Äôs PT is a universal asset principal token. Staking Native Yield Tokens of the same asset type mints the same universal asset principal token. Simply put, staking stETH, rETH, or Stone will mint the same PT token, rather than different PT tokens. This design allows Native Yield Tokens of the same category to share PT liquidity and enhances their composability.

For example, with ETH, there are currently many LSTs (Liquid Staking Tokens) related to ETH in the market. The liquidity of these tokens is fragmented, with some having ample liquidity and others having less. The liquidity of an LST is often related to its adoption in DeFi programs, such as the depth of liquidity pools like LST/ETH or LST/USDT. The liquidity accumulation process for each LST can be challenging.

Introducing a universal asset principal token (UETH) can reduce these redundant processes. Suppose there is a liquidity-scarce LST called xETH. The market would only need liquidity pools such as UETH/ETH and UETH/USDT. By staking xETH through Outstake to mint UETH, it can connect to the existing liquidity in the market. As more market-validated LSTs are added, liquidity will become increasingly ample.

### Yield Token (YT)

YT represents the right to the yield of staked native yield tokens, obtained by staking native yield tokens and specifying a lock-up period. YT separates the native yield from the native yield tokens, allowing it to be traded on secondary markets and used to build other DeFi Lego components.

#### **A true universal fungible YieldToken**

Unlike YieldTokens from other protocols in the market, which are either NFTs or special FTs (e.g., Pendle), **these are non-fungible**. This characteristic leads to a **lack of liquidity** for YieldTokens and **reduces the composability** of the protocol.

OutStake's YT is a **genuinely fungible token** **(FT),** offering **excellent liquidity and strong composability**. For every 1 native yield token staked for 1 day, 1 YT is minted. If **ùë•** native yield tokens is staked for **ùë¶** days, **ùë•ùë¶** YT will be minted. Therefore, theoretically, 1 YT is anchored to the native yield generated by staking 1 native yield token for 1 day.

YT can be freely traded and can be redeemed at any time to claim the accumulated native yield in the yield pool. When burning YT, the redemption of native yield is proportional to the amount of YT burned relative to the total YT supply.

#### The Stability Mechanism of **YT**

YT is also a **non-USD algorithmic stablecoin** pegged to the **native yield rate**. Theoretically, one YT represents the native yield produced by one native yield token over one day. Since YT is linked to the native yield rate and minted through the staking of native yield tokens, it differs from early algorithmic stablecoins like Luna. The value system of YT is a closed system, ensuring that **a price death spiral will never occur**.

Initially, the redeemable value of YT (the native yield that can be redeemed by destroying YT ) will gradually increase over time from the point when the first YT is minted, theoretically ceasing to grow once it reaches its theoretical value cap. Burning YT will redeem native yield proportionally, so it does not affect its redeemable value. **The redeemable value of YT will only decrease when new YT is minted**, and the decrease will be reaccumulated in the future (due to the staking of new native yield tokens).

However, in practice, some users may burn YT before the lock-up period of their staked native yield token expires, leading to a reduction in YT‚Äôs circulation while native yield continues to accumulate in the yield pool. This can eventually cause YT‚Äôs **redeemable value to exceed its theoretical value cap**, resulting in two possible outcomes:

1. In the future, burning YT will allow for the redemption of more yield, increasing the returns for long-term stakers.

2. Users can stake more Native Yield Tokens to mint new YT and immediately burn it to redeem native yield for arbitrage. However, this will provide more fuel for the next value breakthrough. Additionally, the number of PT minted from new staking will slightly decrease, leading to a higher implied fixed interest rate for the minted POT.

#### Broader prospects

YT is not only a tool for helping long-term stakers earn more yield but also a truly fungible, universal yield token. Additionally, it represents **Web3's first decentralized algorithmic stablecoin anchored to native yield rates**. In the competitive market, YT remains connected to these native yield rates. Looking ahead, Outrun will utilize YT‚Äôs unique features and community to develop even more innovative products.

#### The mathematical model of YT

While YT may appear simple on the surface, the ability for **YT** to be freely traded and for any **YT** holder to redeem native yields at any time introduces a highly complex game-theoretic process and mathematical model.

The following, we construct a **minimal model** to calculate impermanent profit and losses.

Assuming that the accumulated native yield in the YieldPool is 0, and 1 YT is pegged to the yield produced by 1 native yield token over 1 day, which we denote as **ùë¶**.

User A stakes **ùëé** native yield tokens and locks them for **ùëö** days, which will mint **ùëéùëö** YTs. We will consider other users as a collective entity, referred to as User B, who stakes **ùëè** native yield tokens and locks them for **ùëõ** days, which will mint **ùëèùëõ** YTs.

After **ùë°** days:

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/Profit.jpg" alt="" width="563">
</p>

The **Impermanent Profit and Loss Ratio (_IPnLR_)** can be obtained by dividing the actual earnings by the expected earnings and then subtracting 1.\
**_IPnLR = (Actual Earnings / Expected Earnings) - 1_**

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/IPnLR.jpg" alt="" width="342">
</p>

The **impermanent profit and loss (_IPnL_)** can be obtained by multiplying each user's **impermanent profit and loss ratio (_IPnLR_)** by their respective expected earnings.\
_**IPnLa = IPnLRa \* Expected Profit\_A**_\
_**IPnLb = IPnLRb \* Expected Profit\_B**_

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/IPnL.jpg" alt="" width="375">
</p>

From the above figure, we can deduce that there is an impermanent profit and loss conservation between User _A_ and User _B_. If User _A_ and User _B_ lock up their assets for the same duration, both parties would experience no impermanent profit or loss. In other words, an individual user's impermanent profit and loss are correlated with the weighted average duration of other users in the staking pool.

Of course, the above is just a minimal model. The actual situation will be more complex due to the influence of multiple players in the game. Therefore, we will set a maximum lock-up time limit -- _**MaxLockInterval**_. The closer the user's lock-up time is to _**MaxLockInterval**_, the smaller the _**IL**_ and the larger the _**IP**_. Additionally, users can reduce _**IL**_ and obtain more _**IP**_ by redeeming their principal immediately upon the expiration of the lock-up period and then staking to mint REY again. When the user's lock-up time is _**MaxLockInterval**_, there will definitely be no _**IL**_.

Based on the model presented above, Outrun can help long-term stakers earn more income. We believe that ETH staking itself aims to make Ethereum more decentralized and secure. Therefore, users who contribute to the long-term protection of Ethereum should be rewarded more generously.

## The difference between Outstake and Pendle

Currently, Pendle is the most popular native yield staking protocol on the market. Here‚Äôs a comparison of Outstake and Pendle, highlighting the advantages of Outstake and the problems it addresses:

1. **Token Types and Composability**

* **Pendle:** The minted PT (Principal Token) and YT (Yield Token) have expiration dates. PT and YT are not standard ERC20 tokens but are closer to NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). Throughout the operation of the protocol, Pendle deploys numerous PT and YT contracts for the same Native Yield Token with different staking expiration dates, leading to fragmented liquidity and limiting the composability and use cases of assets on Pendle. In particular, YT's value goes to zero upon expiration, further restricting its usability.
* **Outstake:** The minted PT and YT are standard ERC20 tokens with no expiration date and can be freely integrated into other DeFi protocols. During the operation of the protocol, there is only one corresponding YT and PT contract for each Native Yield Token, which enhances composability and flexibility. Importantly, Outstake's PT is a universal asset principal token, allowing the minting of the same PT when staking Native Yield Tokens of the same asset type, thereby sharing liquidity. Additionally, Outstake's YT can be viewed as a stablecoin pegged to the yield rate, enabling users to take long or short positions on the yield rate.

2. **Fixed Rate Yields**

* **Pendle:** The quantity of PT minted is equal to the amount of staked tokens, and PT experiences a time-decreasing negative premium. The fixed-rate yield comes from the negative premium of PT, which represents **the losses incurred by stakers and users who purchase YT**. To obtain a fixed interest rate, users must purchase the corresponding PT. Due to the negative premium of PT, early sellers of PT incur losses, significantly reducing the practical value of PT and making it difficult to integrate into other DeFi applications.
* **Outstake:** The number of PT minted is related to the amount of YT minted and the redeemable value of YT, avoiding the negative premium of PT. Outstake introduces tradable **Position Options Token (POT)**, representing the redemption rights of native yield tokens at the end of the lock-up period. This allows users to obtain fixed-rate rights without trading PT, improving capital efficiency. The yield comes from demand exchanges, not from staking losses.

3. **Staking Duration**

* **Pendle:** The staking duration is determined by the protocol, and users cannot freely choose the staking period.
* **Outstake:** Users can freely select the staking duration, controlling the amount of **PT**  minted. The staking duration is abstracted as **POT**, making the position expiration time a tradable asset, further increasing flexibility.

4. **Yield Sources**

* **Pendle:** Pendle does not generate real external yield; its fixed-rate yield essentially comes from the losses of stakers and users who purchase YT. The high fixed-rate yields of Pendle in the past were primarily due to various airdrop points from Restaking and other protocols, which led users to willingly incur losses in exchange for airdrop rewards, creating a temporary high fixed yield.
* **Outstake:** Through the Outrun ecosystem, which supports multiple assets, Outstake creates a rich arbitrage market and multiple income sources. Users can earn native yields, fixed-rate returns from trading **POT**,  enhancing the overall profitability and scalability of the protocol.
