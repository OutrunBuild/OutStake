/**
 * @dev ERC-20 token with pausable token transfers, minting and burning.
 *
 * Useful for scenarios such as preventing trades until the end of an evaluation
 * period, or having an emergency switch for freezing all token transfers in the
 * event of a large bug.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: This contract does not include public pause and unpause functions. In
 * addition to inheriting this contract, you must define both functions, invoking the
 * {Pausable-_pause} and {Pausable-_unpause} internal functions, with appropriate
 * access control, e.g. using {AccessControl} or {Ownable}. Not doing so will
 * make the contract pause mechanism of the contract unreachable, and thus unusable.
